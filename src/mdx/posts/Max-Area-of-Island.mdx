title: 'Max Area of Island'
excerpt: "You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water. The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island."

# 695. Max Area of Island

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.



### Example 1
<img width="420" height="380" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/01/maxarea1-grid.jpg"/>

```reason
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```
### Example 2

```reason
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:

- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 50
- grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

### Solution explanation:
- First, we run dfs on the grid to find all the islands.
- Then,for each island, we find the maximum area of each island.
- And thne update the maxi with the maximum area for the island.
- Finally, we return the maxi.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n,m,maxi = len(grid),len(grid[0]),0
        def dfs(i, j):
            if i<0 or j<0 or i>=len(grid) or j>=len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] != 1:
                return 0
            maxArea = 1
            grid[i][j] = '#'  # this will act as visited set
            maxArea += dfs(i+1, j)
            maxArea += dfs(i-1, j)
            maxArea += dfs(i, j+1)
            maxArea += dfs(i, j-1)
            return maxArea

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    maxi = max(dfs(i,j),maxi)
        return maxi
